What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creating folder named .git and then files in that directory where it initialized set to untracked status.
I need to initialize to make git knows what file is ready to commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the place for containing files where its ready to commit into repository so it musn't able directly changed 
like it placed in the working directory.
